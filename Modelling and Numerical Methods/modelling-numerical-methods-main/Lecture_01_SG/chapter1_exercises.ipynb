    "## Orthonormal Bases \n",
    "\n",
    "Orthonormal bases have several important properties. For example, reflection or rotation of an orthonormal basis in any real, *n*-dimensional coordinate space will generate another orthonormal basis. In fact, every possible orthonormal basis in a given coordinate space can be obtained by applying some combination of these transformations to the original basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another key feature is that using an orthonormal basis makes it simpler to work out the linear combination of basis vectors that represents a given vector in the coordinate space. For example, imagine $\\textbf{v}_1$, $\\textbf{v}_2$ and $\\textbf{v}_3$ are a set of basis vectors for a real 3D space, we can express any vector in the space (i.e., $\\textbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$) using,\n",
    "$\\textbf{v} = x_1\\textbf{v}_1 + x_2\\textbf{v}_2 + x_3\\textbf{v}_3$, where $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. If the basis is not orthonormal, although we know that appropriate $x_i$ coefficients must exist, we have no way of calculating them without solving a relatively complex system of equations. By contrast, if the basis is orthonormal, determining the values of $x_i$ becomes straightforward since the identity $x_i = \\sum^3_{i=1} \\textbf{v} \\cdot \\textbf{v}_i$ holds.  \n"

    "## A Note on Inner/Dot Product Operations with Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture notes it is mentioned that the inner/dot product of two tensors involves contraction over one index such that the expression $\\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$, can also be written $W_{ik} = T_{ij}S_{jk}$. The contraction in this case is over the $j$ index, i.e., for a fixed value of $i$ and $k$, all terms for different values of $j$ are summed together. The full matrix expression is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{W} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left(T_{11}S_{11}+T_{12}S_{21}+T_{13}S_{31}\\right) & \\left(T_{11}S_{12}+T_{12}S_{22}+T_{13}S_{32}\\right) & \\left(T_{11}S_{13}+T_{12}S_{23}+T_{13}S_{33}\\right) \\\\ \\left(T_{21}S_{11}+T_{22}S_{21}+T_{23}S_{31}\\right) & \\left(T_{21}S_{12}+T_{22}S_{22}+T_{23}S_{32}\\right) & \\left(T_{21}S_{13}+T_{22}S_{23}+T_{23}S_{33}\\right) \\\\ \\left(T_{31}S_{11}+T_{32}S_{21}+T_{33}S_{31}\\right) & \\left(T_{31}S_{12}+T_{32}S_{22}+T_{33}S_{32}\\right) & \\left(T_{31}S_{13}+T_{32}S_{23}+T_{33}S_{33}\\right) \\end{bmatrix}$$.\n",

    "As you can see this dot product operation takes two rank-2 tensors and returns a rank-2 tensor. This operation can be done for two tensors, $\\mathbf{T}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, of any rank provided they share the same dimension. In such a case, the rank of the resulting tensor, $\\mathbf{W}$, can be determined using $\\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{W_{\\cdot}}) = \\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{T})+\\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{S})-2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notes on multiplication of tensors also include an expression for Hooke's law containing the \":\" symbol (i.e., $\\mathbf{\\sigma}=\\mathbf{C}:\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ ). This symbol represents the **double** inner/dot product, which involves contraction over two indices. Since the stiffness matrix, $\\mathbf{C}$, is a rank-4 tensor and strain, $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$, is a rank-2 tensor, Hooke's law can be rewritten as $\\sigma_{ij} = C_{ijkl}\\epsilon_{kl}$, where a contraction occurs over both the $k$ and $l$ indices. Similarly, in the simpler case of our two rank-2 tensors $\\mathbf{T}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, we can write their double dot product as $W=S_{ij}T_{ij}$ where contraction occurs over both $i$ and $j$, giving:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ W = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left(T_{11}S_{11}+T_{12}S_{12}+T_{13}S_{13}\\right)+ \\left(T_{21}S_{21}+T_{22}S_{22}+T_{23}S_{23}\\right) + \\left(T_{31}S_{31}+T_{32}S_{32}+T_{33}S_{33}\\right)\\end{bmatrix}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above double dot product operation takes two rank-2 tensors as input and returns a rank-0 tensor (i.e., a scalar). This relationship between the rank of the resulting tensor and the input tensors, $\\mathbf{T}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$, can be generalised in a manner similar to the standard dot product (i.e., provided dimensions of the input tensors are the same, they can be of any rank). However, in the case of the double dot product, the relationship between input and output ranks is expressed using $\\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{W_{:}}) = \\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{T})+\\textrm{rank}(\\mathbf{S})-4$. This relationship explains why the stress tensor ($\\mathbf{\\sigma}$ in the Hooke's law expression above is rank-2, i.e. the double dot product of a rank-4 tensor and a rank-2 tensor is a rank-2 tensor (4+2-4=2).\n",
    "\n",
    "In \\texttt{numpy}, `np.tensordot` calculates the double dot product of two arrays, $\\mathbf{T}:\\mathbf{S}$, by default (i.e., the `axes=2` flag is set automatically; https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html). However, you could use the same function to calculate the dot product, $\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{S}$, by using the `axes=1` flag, or even the outer product (also known as the tensor or dyadic product), $\\mathbf{T}\\otimes\\mathbf{S}$, using `axes=0`."
