# Modern Programming Methods (MPM)

In this module you will acquire essential skills for developing software in a robust and professional manner. You will learn to compose software for sustainable and reproducible research, carry out test-driven software development and integration and develop software using a version control system. These skills will be developed through creating software using the Python programming language. Further, you will learn to distinguish different sources of errors in software and create tests for these errors. You will also be introduced to cloud computing technologies for computational and data science.

## Learning outcomes:

On successful completion of this module, you will be able to:
1. Design software for sustainable and reproducible research.
2. Build software using test-driven development and continuous integration.
3. Develop software using a version control system. 
4. Create software using the Python programming language. 
5.  Assess different sources of errors in science and engineering software and create tests for these errors.
6. Utilise and deploy cloud computing technologies for computational and data science.

## Module content:

The module will include cover the following topics:
1. Software version control: This is necessary to maintain a detailed record of software as it is developed, including how to work collaboratively. While the skills are portable across many software version control systems, this module will use git with GitHub.
2. Test driven development and continuous integration: Software development is planned around the tests that can be written to ensure correctness, while software version control is integrated with automated testing to monitor software health on a continuous basis.
3. You will be taught how to program in Python and how to use a range of Python modules to perform compute-intensive and data-intensive tasks. This will include the use of cloud-based computing resources.
