    "## Practice exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work through these exercises during the lecture, in the afternoon GTA supported session, or in your own time. Example answers will be available later. Note that the answers given have mostly been written for clarity, rather than necessarily being the most efficient, compact or perfect code.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your time is short, then concentrate on exercises 1, 2, 5 and 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise One: Running Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following commands \n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def square_and_cube(n):\n",
    "    return sorted([i**2 for i in range(n)] + [i**3 for i in range(n)])\n",
    "print(square_and_cube(3))\n",
    "print(square_and_cube(10))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "x = np.linspace(0, 6*np.pi)\n",
    "plt.plot(x, np.sin(x))\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "in a Jupyter notebook, in a vanilla Python interpreter, and in IPython.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In each case, try modifying the `square_and_cube` function to also include the 4th power of `n`.\n",
    "- The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from an iterable. Try accessing the Python help in the ordinary interpreter to discover how to invert the order of the sorted list. Note you'll need to use the `help` function, since the `sorted?` syntax is available in IPython/Jupyter only.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Two: Find the primes\n",
    "\n",
    "Using VS Code (or your own prefered editor), write a Python *script* (i.e. a `.py` file) to output the first 20 prime numbers and run it from a command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "- One way of doing this uses an outer loop counting how many primes you have, and then code to find the next prime number.\n",
    "- Note that a number cannot be prime if it divides by a prime number and that 1 is not prime. \n",
    "- If a number is not prime, it must have at least one factor smaller than its own square root. This can be used to improve the efficiency of your search.\n",
    "- If `a` divides `b` exactly, then `a % b == 0`, which gives a quick test using the modulus operator `%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing your code, you should expect the output for the first 5 primes to be `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to convert the script into a routine to calculate all prime numbers smaller than an input number, $n$ using `sys.argv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [model solution](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise1) for the script is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Three: Find the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script file (i.e. a `.py` file) to calculate the mean of a sequence of numbers. As an extension, make it take extra options (using the `argparse` module) `-b`, `-o` and `-x` to work with with binary (i.e. base 2, with `101 == 5` in decimal), octal (i.e. base 8, with `31 == 25` decimal) and hexadecimal (i.e. base 16 `2A == 42` decimal) numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test your basic script on the following sequences: `1` (mean 1) `1 5 7 13 8` (mean 6.8), `2.5, 4 ,-3.2, 9.3` (mean 3.15).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also try feeding it no input.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Tips_:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the longer version you can use the 2 argument version of the `int` function to change the base of numbers. For example `int('11',2) == 3` and `int('3A', 16) == 58`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model answers are provided for the [short](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise2) exercise and for the [long](https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise3) version which takes options flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Four: Plots in scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script to plot the functions $y=\\sin(x)$, $y=\\cos(x)$ and $y=\\tan(x)$ to screen over the range [0,$2\\pi$] and then run it in a terminal/prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include labels on your axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the script to output a `.png` file to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next do the same to write a `.pdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model answers <a href=\"https://msc-acse.github.io/ACSE-1/lectures/lecture7-solutions.html#exercise3a\">are available</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Five: Fix the script\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the following script into your editor/IDE and run the static analysis tool `pylint` on it. Fix the errors and warnings that it gives you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "value={1:'Ace',11:'Jack',12:'Queen',13:'King'}; \n",
    "for _ in range(2,11):\n",
    "    value[_]=_\n",

    "    \n",
    "   \"\"\"Name of card as a string.\n",

    "print( the_name_of_your_card(2,  s= 3))\n",
    "      \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise Six: Complex square root\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function which accepts a real number and returns the complex square roots of that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should include a docstring conforming to the `numpydoc` standard.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "_Tips_: \n",
    "<ul><li> You can use the `sqrt` function in the `math` module to obtain the square root of a positive real number.</li>\n",
    "<li> Python uses the notation `1j` for a unit length imaginary number (which a mathematician would typically denote $i$), where (loosely) $\\sqrt{-1}=\\pm 1j$.</li></ul>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Make a copy of your script to calculate prime numbers and:\n",
    "- add the ability to read the number of primes to output from the command line,\n",
    "- turn it into a version which can also be used as a module,\n",
    "- test this by running a copy of the interpreter and `import`ing it, then calling your routine.\n",
    "- Try running it from the terminal/Anaconda command prompt using the following syntax:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Turn your \"find the primes\" module file into a package called `primes` by creating a suitable directory structure and an `__init__.py` so that you can access a function to give you the first $n$ primes as well as all primes smaller than $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try `import`ing your new package from the IPython console. Check that you can call your function.\n",
