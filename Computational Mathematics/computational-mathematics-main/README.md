# Computational Mathematics

## Description of content

This module introduces the essential mathematics underpinning computational science and data science. This will underpin both programming projects and applied computational modelling/data science modelling projects where complex computer models are used to simulate physical systems. In order to assist in the studentsâ€™ general Python programming training, computational approaches will be used throughout to assist in the explanation of purely mathematical concepts as well as to implement numerical analysis and scientific computing algorithms from first principles.   


The module will cover the following topics:

* Essentials for mathematical, computational and data science based modelling, including algorithms, code verification and validation, accuracy, convergence, stability, and some introductory probability.
* Linear algebra, including matrices, eigenvalues, rank, null spaces, and linear transformations.
* Introductory material on core computational techniques including interpolation, regression and quadrature.
* Ordinary differential equations, including standard analytical solution methods and simple numerical algorithms for their approximate solution.
* Partial differential equations, including simple numerical algorithms for their approximate solution.




## Learning outcomes

On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:

1. Describe some of the fundamental mathematics underpinning computational science, data science and machine learning.
2. Describe some of the fundamental mathematics and concepts underpinning the representation of physical systems using mathematical and computational based modelling approaches.
3. Derive scientific computing algorithms from mathematical first principles and implement using Python based programming.
