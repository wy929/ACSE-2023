# Advanced Programming 2023/24

## Getting started
This module starts with a primer on C++ programming and will teach you how to develop and build C++ programs. Students will be taught functions and input/output handling, as well as memory handling concepts such as pointers, memory allocation and advanced data structures such as linked lists and trees.
This will be followed by an introduction to object-oriented programming with C++ including how to define and use classes, inheritance, overloaded functions and polymorphism. 
You will be taught practical skills for analysing software for potential bugs as well as quickly locating bugs when they arise using debuggers. Additionally, you will learn how to use profiling techniques to identify performance hotspots in software and gain a practical understanding of the factors that limit the performance of software.
These will all be taught in the context of scientific programming and numerical methods, with relevant examples and exercises being used to illustrate the programming concepts. Regular programming homework/assignments will bring together all the skills that will be learned throughout the course and build upon the skills taught in the previous programming and numerical methods courses as part of EDSML and ACSE.

## Learning outcomes
On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Write programs to solve scientific problems using C++. 
2.	Analyse problems to solve them with algorithms and software. 
3.	Analyse and identify opportunities for refining computer programs. 
4.	Manage contributions to group work coordinating and cooperating with peers. 

## Getting Started
In preparation for your Advanced Programming (AP) lectures we have the following instructions/info:
*	We will be primarily using either Microsoft Visual Studio, an IDE (integrated development environment) for the C++ programming language Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (Windows) (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), or Microsoft Visual Studio Code (Mac), a fully featured open-source editor (https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
*	The most basic edition of Visual Studio, the Community edition (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), is available free of charge. This is available for C++ for Windows only (and includes a compiler). This is an advanced, integrated coding platform with compiler.
*	Visual Studio Code is available for Windows, Mac and Linux and is free. Please be aware you will need to have a separate C++ compiler installed if you chose to use Visual Studio Code. This is an 'enhanced editor'.
*	Please install either Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 or Microsoft Visual Studio Code (and a C++ compiler if needed) on your computers. If you have a different preferred editor or compiler, please feel free to use it. 
*	The installation for Visual Studio Community 2022 may take a few hours. After you download the install program for Visual Studio Community 2022 and run it, you will be presented with a screen. Select the option to install "Desktop development with C++”. After installing Visual Studio Community make sure that you can create and save a file to a local folder. 
*	During our first class we will make sure that everyone has access to their chosen IDE/editor we will get started on some simple IDE tasks to set us up for the lectures. To try out code quickly, you can use https://cpp.sh which is an online shell for C++.
*	You can use the “Live Share” extension available for both Visual Studio Community and Visual Studio Code to share code collaboratively (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/). 
*	Please consider following the C++ Primer course available here: https://ese-msc.github.io/c-primer/intro.html 

## Schedule and Structure of Lectures
The course will take place over three weeks. During the first and second week you will receive daily lectures, between 9:30 and 12:30. All lectures will be in person in RSM 1.51 and streamed to 1.49/50, and online on Teams. Questions during the lecture can be made by raising your hand during class, or can be placed on the Teams chat for that lecture. During the last week there will be two lectures on Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 9.30 am. 

An example structure of a lecture, as an example, will be:
* 35 Minutes Lecture
* 15 min - Exercise 
* 10 min - Break
* Repeat

## Materials
Links to materials will appear here during the module

  ## Evaluation
In all coursework standard plagiarism rules apply. See Imperial College Guidelines for “Plagiarism, Academic Integrity & Exam Offences” here: http://www.imperial.ac.uk/student-records-and-data/for-current-students/undergraduate-and-taught-postgraduate/exams-assessments-and-regulations/plagiarism-academic-integrity--exam-offences/. In particular, the individual in-class coursework, must be completed by yourself alone with no external help; please note that unfortunately students have been caught and sanctioned for plagiarism in previous years. You will be able to make use of all the code you have written during your individual coursework for the group assignment if you wish to do so.

### Individual Assessment
1. The will be two individual courseworks (25% of grade each).
2. The best way to prepare for the coursework is to complete the practicals.
3. Each individual coursework will be released on Monday during class and will have to be submitted by 16:00 the following Friday. 
 
### Group Project
1. Group Coursework (50% of grade).
2. Introductory Session: Tuesday 12th March, 14:00.
3. Groups will have be automatically generated, and announced at the introductory session.
