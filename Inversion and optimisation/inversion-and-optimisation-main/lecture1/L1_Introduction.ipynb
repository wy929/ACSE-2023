    "## Summary <a class=\"tocSkip\"></a>\n",
    "In today's lecture we will first briefly discuss the role of Inversion and Optimisation in science and engineering. We will start with the inversion of linear systems. For this we first need to revise some of the key concepts of Linear Algebra that you've already encountered in _Computational Mathematics_. We will extend these to linear systems with fewer, or more equations than unknowns, i.e. based on non-square matrices. We will spend some time on the technique of Gaussian Elimination, and the LU decomposition which are central to direct methods of solving linear systems. For over-determined systems (more equations than unknowns) we look at the Least Squares method, and for under-determined (fewer equations than unknowns) we look at the minimum norm solution. We will finish our treatment of non-square systems in tomorrow's lecture with the Singular Value Decomposition and the generalized inverse.\n",

This relies on some understanding of how the unknown physical properties $\\boldsymbol{x}$ (e.g. vegetation) will affect the actual measured data (e.g. the reflected radiation observed by satelites), in other words we need a mathematical forward model $F(\\boldsymbol{x})$ that predicts for every possible value of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ what the actual measured values $\\boldsymbol{y}$ would be, so that for a given measurement $\\boldsymbol{y}$ we can invert for the actual $\\boldsymbol{x}$ by solving the inversion problem $F(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\boldsymbol{y}$.

    "### A more complex Inversion example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example from some current research we have a model for tides in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary, there are multiple numerical and physical \"parameters\" that go into the model, including incoming tidal boundary conditions, bathymetry etc, some of which are known to varying levels of uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we consider bed roughness (or bottom friction) as the parameters we wish to invert for, given the data of time series of tidal heights at tide gauges indicated by the red dots in the following image which also shows the discretised domain and the computational mesh\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/mesh.png\" width=\"500x\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using *a priori* information on the approximate distribution of sediment grain sizes on the seabed, we partition the domain into three zones: rock, gravel and sand, and assign one parameter value to each. In this case we therefore have more data than parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case an iterative approach is taken and the following figure shows how the inversion progresses\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/thetis_inversion_convergence.png\" width=\"400x\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "$J$ is a misfit function between modelled tides and observations from real work tide gauges, and we solve the inversion problem by seeking to minimse $J$ - we see it drop as the model fit to data improves with iteration. How the three parameter values vary with iteration is also shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quality of the prediction can then be compared at the green squares where data was not used in the inversion. We find that the error in  prediction at these independent locations is indeed reduced within the same numerical model. We have also found that the prediction is improved when these physical values are used in a completely independent tidal model. This latter fact gives us some indication that our inversion is telling us something useful physically and not simply correcting for biases in the first model.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Optimisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's quickly review what ***optimisation*** is an how it relates to inversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimisation, in a single real variable, seeks to find a value for $x$ such that a scalar function \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "has a minimum value (or equivalently that $-f(x)$ has a maximum value).    \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $f(x)$   might  be  the  energy  of  a  particle  at  position  $x$. The  value  of  $x$  for  which  this  is  a  minimum will provide a rest position for the particle. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or we could have a problem where we are seeking a design of something that minimises cost or maximises profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "There  are  many  ways  to  solve  such  problems,  and  again  there  is  no  general  solution.  In practical real problems, there may be no solution, a single unique solution, several solutions  or infinitely many solutions.  "

    "# Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions and the rank of a matrix\n",
    "In the first three lectures we will concentrate on solving (large!) linear systems of equations efficiently, before we move on to inverting and optimising more complex nonlinear functions. As you will find out in later lectures, many nonlinear solver algorithms rely on the repeated solution of a linearised version of the nonlinear problem, so even there efficient linear solver algorithms are an essential ingredient. Today we will focus in particular on linear systems where the number of equations is not necessarily the same as the number unknowns. We will start with revising the question of how to determine whether a linear system has a solution and, if so, whether it is unique - you have seen this before in the _Computational Mathematics_ module, but today we want to make sure in particular that we have a more generalized picture of how this works even for non-square matrices."

    "An equivalent way of saying that the equations have a solution (existence of a solution) for a given right-hand side vector, is that the equations are consistent, i.e. they are not contradicting each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above three cases we can see that if the matrix is over-determined, or is rank-deficient, a solution does not always exist for every right-hand side vector. In practice however this means that inversion problems based on such a matrix do not have an exact solution in almost all practical cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for instance we look at a classical inversion problem where we try to match some unknown properties $\\boldsymbol{x}$ through a linear forward model (represented by the matrix) with measurements in a right-hand side vector $\\boldsymbol{b}$; If some of the rows are linearly dependent, we only get a solution if that linear dependence is consistent with the measurements in the right-hand side vector. In practice however, there will always be measurement errors, and model errors, so that the chance of the right-hand side vector indeed being consistent is practically zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if our model is a linear regression that tries to match measurements at specific locations where we expect some variability (over time) in the measured values. We might (accidentily or on purpose) end up with multiple measurements at the same location. In the linear regression matrix, this corresponds to rows that are identical and therefore linearly dependent; Because of the variability however we do not expect the right-hand side entries corresponding with these rows to be exactly the same - and thus an exact solution does not exist."

    "## Mixed determined\n",
    "An under-determined system only guarantees existence of a solution, and an over-determined system only guarantees uniqueness if the matrix is full-rank. We will also call this purely under-determined and purely over-determined respectively. If the matrices are not full-rank, but rank-deficient, this is often called mixed-determined, in which case neither existence nor uniqueness are guaranteed. This term also applies to the rank-deficient equi-determined case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed determined cases often involve situations where some unknowns (or linear combinations of unknowns) are described by too many equations, and some unknowns by too few equations. In a sense they can thus be described as a combination of (purely) over-determined and under-determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, large, real-world, inversion problems are likely to be mixed-determined.  In practice it can also be very difficult to discover if a large system is mixed determined or not, and so in practical problems we will often proceed by assuming that the problem is mixed-determined, employing an iterative numerical approach."

As we explained above if the solution space is $n$-dimensional ($n$ columns in the matrix), then each equation adds a new constraint (as long as the equations are independent!). The space of vectors that satisfies just one equation is $n-1$ dimensional. The space that satisfies two linearly independent equations is $n-2$ dimensional, etc.\n",

In other words, even if the $a_{ii}$ is already reasonably large, we search in the column below if we can find an even larger value to use as the pivot.
