## Assessments
The assessment of this module consists of two pieces of coursework:
* coursework on the Full Wave-form Inversion method introduced in the second
  week, which will be released on Wednesday the 21st at 12:00 with a deadline 
on Friday the 23rd at 12:00 midday.
* coursework on the theory covered in lectures 1-5 and 9-11, 
which will be released on the 28th of February at 12:00
with a deadline on the 1st of March at 12:00 midday.

The assessments will be released via github Classrooms and should be submitted
in the form of a jupyter notebook. More detailed instructions are provided with
the coursework release.
