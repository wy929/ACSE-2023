# inversion-and-optimisation-assessment-1

Base repository for the first assessment of inversion and optimisation. See `assessment.ipynb` for a description of the assessment criteria.

Solutions for parts 1, 2 and 3 of the assessment should be written in the notebooks `solution_part1.ipynb`, `solution_part2.ipynb` and `solution_part3.ipynb` respectively.

Note that you may split your solutions to parts 2 and 3 into several notebooks, e.g. `solution_part2a.ipynb`, `solution_part2b.ipynb`, etc. should you wish, but this is not required.
