    "# Advanced Data Preparation with Pipelines -  Geochemical Survey Canada\n",
    "\n",
    "This data problem was given as assessed coursework in 2022. It presents a great opportunity to practice your skills with pipelines and data preparation, as well as EDA and general thinking. Your client is the **Canadian Government**. As part of their ***open government*** digital initiative, they have collected a lot of information about river sediments and the general river conditions in the Province of British Columbia.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canadian Government has many data scientists, so they are <strong style=\"color:brown\">not interested in you doing any machine learning modelling</strong>. Rather, they need you to prepare the data for them, so their overpaid data scientists can do the modelling with already prepared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Regional Canada wants you to do is the following:\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Load the data by running the cell below: <strong style=\"color:blue\">this will be all the training data that you have</strong>. Since you are not doing any machine learning modelling, consider all of the features to be your <code>X</code> features (there is no <code>y</code> in this exercise).</p>\n",
    "<p>üçÅ In order <strong>to be fair</strong> when assessing your work against others, the Canadian Government informs you that for any algorithm where a <strong style=\"color:blue\">random state</strong> is needed you should use <code>random_state=42</code>. Note that this does not necessarily imply that you need an operation that requires a random_state: but if you do, use 42 so you can be fairly assessed against other biders!</p> \n",
    "<p>üçÅ The client also informs you that they intend to use your <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code> sets (see instructions below) for their own machine learning modeling in order to <strong style=\"color:blue\">predict properties outside of British Columbia</strong>, so take this into consideration when you prepare the data.</p>\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Your client is <strong>NOT interested in advanced feature engineering</strong>: so, for instance, don't bother with FeatureCross or coming up with new features as they don't want this at this stage and won't reward you for it.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective I\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Your first objective is to  <strong style=\"color:blue\">prepare</strong> a <code>X_train</code> (80% of the dataset), and a <code>X_test</code> (20% of the dataset). You need to prepare the two sets following the <strong style=\"color:blue\">best practices in data science</strong>, and you need to name these objects in your notebook <code>X_train</code> and <code>X_test</code>.</p> \n",
    "<p>üçÅ Your client want you to create a pipeline to <strong style=\"color:teal\">process the numerical features in your dataset</strong>. This data preparation pipeline should be called <code>num_pipe</code>. You should  <strong>remove unnecessary numerical features</strong>, but you need to make a good case as to <strong style=\"color:blue\">why</strong> you remove the features, i.e. it needs to be motivated by sound data science principles for future ML modelling. It is advisable to use a <strong>markdown</strong> cell to explain to your client why you would remove certain features.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective II\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Your client also wants you to <strong style=\"color:teal\">prepare the categorical features</strong>, but in this case they want you to <strong style=\"color:blue\">retain all categorical features</strong> as they don't know what will be useful, and what will not be useful. Call your categorical pipeline <code>cat_pipe</code></p>\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Then, the client wants both your <code>num_pipe</code> and your <code>cat_pipe</code> to be <strong style=\"color:teal\">wrapped in a single, final data pipeline able to process raw data</strong>: they want this pipeline to be saved in your notebook as <code>final_preprocessor</code>. The Government has more data and they intend to prepare it using your pipeline for evaluation.</p>\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Make sure to use your <code>final_preprocessor</code> to transform your <code>X_train</code> and <code>y_train</code> in your notebook: these will be assessed too (you need to transform them and save them under the same name for the test to run properly).</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective III\n",
    "<p>üçÅ Once you are done with this work, write your code in the <code>GeochemPrep</code> class (see <code>river_geochemistry.py</code> that will automatically learn the features of your data when you use the <code>.fit</code> method, and transform it with <code>.transform</code>. You can create as many other methods in the class as you see fit, but I will test your code by giving it an <code>X_train</code> as input for training, and check the output with the <code>.transform</code> method. In essence, this class should simply be the code you already wrote but nicely packaged and thus reusable (and don't worry about the train-test-split part).</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Your client will judge your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "<p>‚ùÑÔ∏è How clean and easy to read your code is, and how well structure your notebook is: this includes using markdown cells to explain your decisions if needed (don't justify all basic decisions though: the code needs to speak for itself)</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùÑÔ∏è The overall performance of your pipeline at preparing similar data from <strong>an unseen dataset</strong>.</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùÑÔ∏è Whether or not you have demonstrated through code that your solution follows the best practices of data science, and is as complete as possible.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "###  ü¶´ Good luck!"
