    "This is a data problem that was part of the 2022/23 assessed coursework. Obviously the coursework will be different this year, but this gives you a sense of what is expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a consultant in scientific machine learning, and your first client is **NASA**! They have had a lot of success with their recent **Double Asteroid Redirection Test**, or **DART** mission: now, they have an increased buget and they want to spend it on some predictive machine learning. This is where you come into play: you will help **NASA** train a machine learning algorithm that can determine whether or not a near-Earth asteroid is <span style=\"color:teal\">hazardous</span> (dangerous). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### What NASA wants you to do is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è <strong style=\"color:blue\">Load the training data</strong> (<code>asteroid_training.csv</code>). This contains your <code>y</code> target (<code>hazardous</code>), and all the other potential features <code>X</code>that you can choose to use to predict <code>y</code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è NASA says you can <strong style=\"color:blue\">prepare the data</strong> anyway you feel is best (you have complete freedom here). Save the final prepared data as variable named <code>X_train_prep</code> in your notebook. Note that this needs to be a Pandas DataFrame (used in the code test).</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è In order <strong>to be fair</strong> when assessing your work against others, NASA informs you that for any algorithm where a <strong style=\"color:blue\">random state</strong> is needed you should use <code>random_state=42</code>. Note that this does not necessarily imply that you need an operation that requires a random_state: but if you do, use 42 so you can be fairly assessed against other biders!</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è Once your data is prepared, NASA wants you to <strong style=\"color:blue\">train a predictive machine learning algorithm</strong>. But they give you <span style=\"color:red\"><strong>further constraints</strong></span>:\n",
    "    <li>1. Your algorithm can only be a <strong style=\"color:purple\">linear model</strong> (so don't use any fancy RandomForest, KNN or XGBoost: NASA is too old school for that)</li>\n",
    "    <li>2. NASA will evaluate your model against metrics that determines the <strong style=\"color:purple\">overall performance of the model at any threshold</strong></li></p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è Using your <code>final_model</code>, <strong style=\"color:blue\">estimate</strong> the performance of your algorithm on unseen data and save this in a variable called <code>predicted_performance</code></p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è Using your <code>final_model</code>, <strong style=\"color:blue\">predict</strong> whether or not the unknown asteroids contained in the file <code>unknown_asteroids.csv</code> are hazardous. Your prediction should be an array of <code>0</code> (not hazardous) and <code>1</code> (hazardous)</p>\n",
    "<p>‚ùáÔ∏è <strong style=\"color:blue\">Save your prediction to file</strong> (see pandas's <code>to_csv</code>) making sure to <strong>NOT INCLUDE THE INDEX</strong>. The filename should be <code>predictions.csv</code></p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NASA will judge your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "<p>‚úÖ How clean and easy to read your code is, and how well structure your notebook is: this includes using markdown cells to explain your decisions if needed (don't justify all basic decisions though: the code needs to speak for itself)</p>\n",
    "<p>‚úÖ The overall performance of your algorithm at predicting whether a near-Earth object is hazardous <strong>on an unseen dataset</strong> (see note above in point <code>2</code>).</p>\n",
    "<p>‚úÖ Whether or not you have demonstrated through code that your solution follows the best practices of data science.</p>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a pretty open-ended exercise, so be imaginative. Don't forget to do some solid EDA to understand your data. Also, always use `random_state=42` for the test to assess you fairly. And don't forget all the best practices you have learned in the course!"
