    "# Introduction to Core Data\n",
    "\n",
    "![glomar](http://deepseadrilling.org/images/challenger1.jpg)<br>\n",
    "One of the objectives of this module is to familiarize yourself with new data types. Geologist learn a lot about the history of the Earth by studying core material, i.e. cylindrical pieces of rock recovered from the subsurface by a drill string. Drilling for cores can be performed on land, or at sea from a drilling vessel. One famous drilling vessel is the R/V JOIDES Resolution. I also used to work as a staff scientist on the JOIDES Resolution (aka \"JR\") before joining Imperial College, so I know it well. The JR is operated by the <a href=\"https://www.iodp.org/\">International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP, 2003-today)</a>, which was preceded by the <a href=\"http://www-odp.tamu.edu/\">Ocean Drilling Program (ODP, 1985-2003)</a> and the <a href=\"http://deepseadrilling.org/about.htm\">Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP, 1966-1985)</a>. The various version of the ocean drilling program thus represents one of the major investment in Earth Science over the last 55 years, and has acquired a treasure trove of core and logging data. We will take full advantage of this here.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "![cores](https://www.iodp.org/images/right_side_random_images/357_mircobio_carolcotterill.jpg)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we will be using ODP/IODP data extensively in this course it is worth defining what the different terms represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Leg' refers to the particular expedition the drill ship was on. In more recent IODP cruises, this is referred to as the 'Expedition' or 'Exp'. Think of a leg as a 6-9 week-long cruise with a single crew, addressing a single research objective. Leg or Expedition are represented by a sequential <code>Int</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "'Site' means the name of the general area that was drilled, which is also a sequential number. At each site, the vessel can drill multiple wells, known a 'Hole' and often represented with the letter 'H'. The wells are represented by an ordered <code>str</code>: 'A', 'B', 'C', etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a drilling vessel aims to recover a continuous section of rock, for practical reasons this is not possible. Thus, pipes are added to the drill string as coring down continues, and a length of rock nominally the length of the drilling pipe is recovered. The pipes on the JR are 9.8 meters, and so we recover cores of 9.8 meters. Cores are denoted with a unique number ('Cor'), followed by the tool used for coring ('T'), which is a 1 character designation of the drilling technique used (more about this later in the course). 'Sc' designates the section: each 9.8 meters-long core is cut into 1.5 meters sections for easy handling, with the addition of the core catcher 'CC' which represents material not in the core liner (in oder words, we are not sure where this material comes from - the core itself, the side of the hole, or the seafloor). For each sample from the ocean drilling program, a 'Top(cm)' is defined and represents the cm down from the top of the section where the sample is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, an ODP/IODP sample can be fully spatially resolved by the combination of the parameters we have described above (and that are always supplied as part of the dataset as a unique identifyer). For instance, an example of a sample would be ODP Sample **198-1207-A-2-H-2-65**. This means that this particular sample comes from ODP Leg 198, Site 1207, Hole A (or 'well A'), core 2 drilling with a piston corer ('H'), section 2, 65 cm down section. With this information the 'Depth (mbsf)' which is the depths below seafloor of any sample can be calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple sets of properties can be measured on a core sample, either onboard the ship or postcruise, once the scientists are back onshore. All of this information can be precisely correlated and used by data scientists like yourselves.\n",
