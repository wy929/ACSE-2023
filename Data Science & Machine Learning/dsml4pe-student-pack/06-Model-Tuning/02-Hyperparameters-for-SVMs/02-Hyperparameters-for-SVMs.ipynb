What we will do is the following:\n",

    "2. Sample a small portion of the train set (**10% in our case**) as the data as our `validation_set`. Note that this will only be used to speed up some of our tests: we will use cross validation for hyperparameter searching. This means that **you should not replace the `X_train` and `y_train`** that you made in step 1. Instead, you can use train-test-split on the `train_set` but assign the 90% of the train set to the variable `_` (underscore). This is a convention in Python for a variable we won't be using.\n",
