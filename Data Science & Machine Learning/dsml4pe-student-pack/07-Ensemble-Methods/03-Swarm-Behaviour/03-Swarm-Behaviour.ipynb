This Data Problem is a modified version of one of the questions that I asked during the assessment in 2021, so this give you a flair for the practical to come. Note that this is a relatively open-ended question. Generally, I also ask a few questions that are more targetted first, and the opened ended question comes at the end. The open ended question is really here for you to show how much you have learned as a data scientists. \n",
