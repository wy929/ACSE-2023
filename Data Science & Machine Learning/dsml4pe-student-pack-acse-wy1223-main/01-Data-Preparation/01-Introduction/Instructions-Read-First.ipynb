For instance, I would ask you to \"save the value of your `accuracy_score` into a variable named `score`\". Make sure to save the variable in that name, and beware of capitalization. Otherwise, the test will fail.\n",
    "* Tests are not perfect: passing a test could still mean you have a bug, and not passing a test could mean I have a bug in my code. So, use your good judgement.\n",
    "* The tests are for you, not for me: I don't collect the test scores, and this does not contribute to your module mark. So use them to guide your coding: run the tests!!!\n",
