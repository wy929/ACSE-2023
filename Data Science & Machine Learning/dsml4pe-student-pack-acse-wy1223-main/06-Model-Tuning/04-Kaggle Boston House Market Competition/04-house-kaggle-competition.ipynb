    "üéØ The `ML_Houses_dataset.csv` is a classic made up of 84 features! The data comes from the Boston housing market. Here, you can practice doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Investigate the features\n",
    "- Preprocess and encode them accordingly\n",
    "- Brainstorm feature engineering\n",
    "- Add them to your modelling\n",
    "- Perform feature selection\n",
    "- Train and test models\n",
    "- Enter your best performance into the <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques\">Kaggle House Price Competition</a> to measure yourselve against other data scientists (make sure to read the rules: they ask for some peculiar metrics, and you may need to download the data straight from them if you want to enter the competitions)"
