# 🌍 Data Science and Machine Learning for Planet Earth - Exercises

## 🔗 Installing the dependencies

Let's start with the most important: how to install your dependencies so you can practice the exercises. This assumes you have a `conda` environment.

In a terminal, navigate to the module directory (where this `README.md` file is located). Then, to create the `dsml4p` environment run:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

The environment can then be activated via

`conda activate dsml4p`

## 📚 Course overview and learning outcomes 

Welcome to the exercises for your <strong style = "color:teal">Data Science and Machine Learning for Planet Earth</strong> module. This module will introduce the concepts central to the data science, including working in a computational notebook environment, data preparation and data pipelines, and different types of classical machine learning algorithms for regression, classification and clustering.

This module's learning outcomes are:
1.	Describe the different steps involved in a data science / machine learning project, from initial data exploration to production code. 
2.	Clean and manipulate different types of data and prepare them for machine learning analysis using open source libraries. 
3.	Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the problem at hand and  optimize the predictions by tuning hyperparameters 
4.	Test the performance of a machine learning pipeline through various performance metrics 

The plan for the module is:
* **Day 1**: Data Preprocessing 🧹 (***live in 1.47***)
* **Day 2**: Performance metrics 📏 (***live in 1.49/1.50***)
* **Day 3**: Optimization 🕵️ (***live in 1.51***)
* **Day 4**: Deep-Dive into Data Modelling 🤿 (***live in 1.47***)
* **Day 5**: ML Workflow 👷 (***live in 1.49/1.50***)
* **Day 6**: Model tuning 🎵 (***live in 1.51***)
* **Day 7**: Ensemble Learning 🫐 (***live in 1.47***)
* **Day 8**: Natural Language Processing 📰 (***live in 1.49/1.50***)
* **Day 9**: Unsupervised Learning 👻 (***live in 1.51***)
* **Day 10**: Assessed coursework (9 am to 5 pm) 🧪

The coursework starts at ***9 am on November 17th 2023***, it is timed (last push on GitHub at 17:00), and you **MUST** do it on your own.

# 🔱 Philosophy of the module

* 👩‍💻 This is a coding module: most of the exercises are about solving data problem through code. Math is important as it allows you to understand the algorithm, but the emphasis is on coding and good code. **DO YOUR EXERCISES**. Sure, the theory is important, but you can learn the fine details on your own later. The most important is to be able to solve problems.
* 🆘 Try to solve the problem on your own for a while, before asking for help or using the hints
* 🧪 Make use of the self-tests within the notebooks to check your own work. **The tests are not perfect:** there is always new bugs we find. So if the test is strange but you are convinced your code is right, ask a TA for help.
* 📚 Make sure to **read the documentation** of the different libraries you will be using. Making sense of the documentation is a crucial skill to build. You are expected to be able to go read the doc in order to find the best `Class` or `method` to use (and how to use it).
* 🪲 Always attempt to debug your own code: this is another essential skill and the exercises this week will likely lead to bug, and you will need to spend time finding them. By putting the effort trying to sort your code, you will ensure you build a lifelong ability to develop software. A great resource when you are stuck is `stack overflow`
* 🧑‍🏫 Of course, if you are stuck for too long or need an explanation, the TAs and teachers are here and happy to help!

# 🗺️ Structure of the exercises

* 📁 There is one folder per day of course, except the last Friday: no course on the last Friday nor exercises apart from the assessed timed coursework (9 am - 5 pm GMT).
* 🗂️ In each daily folder, you will find **the lecture notes as a Jupyter notebook** as well as subfolders containing the exercises. The associated data can be downloaded automatically by running the first cell of the notebook, but if this does not work, there is also a copy of the data on your daily lecture channel on MSTeams.
* 🎲 There should be about 4 exercises (sometimes 5) for a full day, and 2 exercises for Wednesdays (half-days)
* ⚖️ I anticipate that all of you should be able to do the first two exercises, and most of you 3 out of 4 exercises. If you manage the 4, well done!
* 📔 The exercises are in `Jupyter notebooks`: you can use `Jupyter notebook` or `Jupyter lab` to open them and complete them
* 🐺 You can work independently or in small groups on the exercises, at your own pace. Keep in mind that the assessment will be individual though!
* 🎤 Every day except on Wednesdays, we will have **live code starting at 4:00 pm**. This is optional, but is your chance to see me code some of the problems I gave you (or new ones), and answer any questions you might have. I am planning to do this in room 1.51 as it is optional and this is our largest room. But keep a look for updates.

# 🤖 Guide to using ChatGPT / Co-Pilot

* ✅ Αre you allowed to use AI tools? Yes! This is a resource, just like any other resources. You should fully use them alongside `stack overflow`. But **efficient use** is key: you really need to know what you are doing.
* 🐣 First, think about your learning, and how this will help you when you interview for a job, or try to solve a novel problem on your own - if there is no solution out there, none of the tools will help you.
* 🕸️ Second, these tools are trained on legacy data - this means that their coding style is old, especially given how quickly ML tools evolve. For instance, `scikit-learn` has undergone a major revision late last year, which changes the way we code some exercises. If you ask ChatGPT, your solution will look odd and you will lose points for not having the best coding style.
* 🧗 In summary, to use the tools well, you need to understand what you are coding, and to understand what you are coding, you need to go through some sweat and tears to do things from scratch. Otherwise, you may never improve your coding style and over-rely on automated tools.
* 🤔 Ethical Use and Academic Integrity: Please check the student Handbook for the college level policy.
* 🔍 Critical Thinking and Verification: AI tools provide suggestions, not absolute truths. Always verify the accuracy and applicability of the information. Critical thinking is key – don't accept AI outputs at face value.
* ⏳ Dynamic Nature of AI Tools: Be aware that AI tools are constantly evolving. What they provide today might change tomorrow. Keep up-to-date with the latest advancements and limitations of these tools for the most effective use.
* 💡 Hands-On Experience with AI Limitations: It's essential to recognize the limitations of AI. Through specific assignments, you'll experience where AI falls short, helping you understand when and how to rely on these tools, and more importantly, when not to.
* 🧪 In addition, for the assessment, you will be given a `references.md` file which you are asked to update with any books, websites or AI tools you use to help you in writing the codes in the assessments. For tutorial sites, the main URL or landing page you used will suffice. For Q&A sites (e.g. Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange), or when interacting with ChatGPT please link the specific question/response which helped you.
