    "# The Learning Curve\n",

    "This exercise will get you more familiar with the concept of the learning curve, and how to use it appropriately. Let's start by opening our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load and prepare the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with an IODP dataset that I assembled myself, and that contains porosity measured from logs as well as various information on the cores. Open the `core_data.csv` dataset in your `Datasets` folder. To make your life a little easier, I have already cleaned the dataset for you: there are no duplicates or null values and the data has been scaled using a `MinMaxScaler` (except for our target variable). Don't take my word for it: explore quickly the data to convince yourself that this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now do the following using a `random_state` value of 42:\n",
    "1. Create a `y` target variable that contains only the `Porosity (vol%)` values, and a feature set (`X`) that contains all of the other features\n",
    "2. Split `X` and `y` into `X_train`/`y_train` (70% of the data) and `X_test`/`y_test` (30% of the data)\n",
    "3. Further split the `X_train`/`y_train`  into `X_train`/`y_train` (80% of the original `X_train`/`y_train` ) and `X_val`/`y_val`  (20% of the original `X_train`/`y_train` )\n",

    "# Plotting the learning curve\n",
    "\n",
    "Time to put what you have learned in practice! We will assess how well a simple `LinearRegression` model applies to our dataset by monitoring the learning curve. For this, you will need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a loop that will run `m` times, `m` being the number of samples in your `X_train` **divided by 10 and rounded down to the nearest integer** (to make the whole thing a bit faster!). In concrete terms, `m` should be equal to `281`.\n",
    "2. At each loop iteration do the following: \n",
    "   a. train a `LinearRegression` based on the `X_train[0:m*10]` and `y_train[0:m*10]` data points\n",
    "   b. predict the `y_train[0:m*10]` based on the `X_train[0:m*10]` and calcuate a `RMSE_score`. Save this value in a `train_rmse` list.\n",
    "   c. predict `y_pred` based on the entire `X_val` data and calculate a `RMSE_score` based on `y_pred` and `y_val`. Save this in a `val_rmse` list.\n",
    "3. Plot the two curves (`train_rmse` and `val_rmse`) against number of training data to see the training curve: because your list will be sorted in increasing number of `X_train` samples, all you need to do is plot the values of the lists on the y-axis and the index of the item on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:** You will need to do this exercise multiple times in this notebook, so you might want to consider writing two functions to do so. Why two, and not one function? Well, points 1. and 2. above take a long time to compute, so you don't want to have to repeat them too often. On the other hand, point 3. (the plot) is quick, and you may decide to zoom in on some of the areas of the plot. So I recommend to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write one function (mine is called `calculate_learning_curves`) that will take care of points 1. and 2. above. You would pass a model to the function (for instance, LinearRegression) and the data (`X_train`, `X_val`, `y_train`, `y_val`),  it would calculate the two lists (`train_rmse` and `val_rmse`) and return them. \n",
    "* Write a second function (mine is called `plot_learning_curves`) to actually plot the learning curve in your notebook. This function would be passed the values of `train_rmse` and `val_rmse` as inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions for you to answer::** \n",
    "* How does the curve look in general?\n",
    "* How does the curve look when you zoom in between (0,200) on the x-axis, and (0,20) on the y-axis. You can use `plt.axis([0, 200, 0, 20])` to change the limits of your axis (but there are other ways to do that too). \n",
    "* How does the curve look at the end of training (`[2500, 2800, 10, 12]`)? What can you conlude about the suitability of a linear regression for this task?"

Instead, it finds the best compromise between all of the training instances (an instance is how we call a datapoint).

As a consequence, the RMSE of the training curve increases (now we are not fitting all of our instances) but importantly the error on the test curve is decreasing.</li>\n",
