    "# Introducing `Feature Crosses`\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to a very important concept: that of a `feature crosses`. Simply put, a feature cross is a synthetic feature that is the combination of two or more features together: independently, none of these features may be very strong predictors. But when associated, they become powerful! You can <a hread=\"https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/feature-crosses/video-lecture#:~:text=A%20feature%20cross%20is%20a,an%20understanding%20of%20feature%20crosses.\">watch this brief video from Google</a> about `feature crosses` if you want to know more, or <a hreaf=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-feature-crosses-still-important-machine-learning-rakesh-sharma/\">read this article</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the coordinates of the city give us a clear opportunity to practice feature crossing: we have both the `Latitude` and the `Longitude` of the cities in separate columns. However, a location is a combination (`feature cross`!) of both `latitude` and `longitude`. Simply creating a new column that contains a string in the form of `{Latitude}_{Longitude}` would not be enough though: we need to encode the entire space of possible parameters to create a high-dimentional feature space. Then we can represent each combination of `Latitude` and `Longitude` as a unique vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, you will need to write three functions: `train_encoder`, `encode_features`, and `create_feature_cross`. Let's walk through them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `train_encoder`\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this function is to train a `OneHotEncoder` on all possible combinations of `Latitude` and `Longitude` rounded to the nearest full degree. The function will return a trained `OneHotEncoder`. Here are a few useful tips when writing this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember that you can cast a `float` to an `int` to round the values: I suggest you use this approach here\n",
    "2. You might want to generate two lists: one of all possible `latitudes` (from `-90` to `+90`) and one of all possible `longitudes` (from `-180` to `+180`). **Remember:** We are trying to encode each full degree here, i.e. `int`s. The `np.arrange` function might be your best friend here!\n",
    "3. You probably want to create a list that will contain all of your possible combinations of features (let's call it `corpus`, but you can choose another name)\n",
    "4. You might want to loop through all `latitudes`, and then for each `latitude` value combine it with all possible values of `longitude`. Then append this combination as a string (for instance, `\"34_-123\"` for 34N and 123W) to your list\n",
    "5. To save you a lot of grief in your next function, I recommend you turn your `corpus` list into a `pd.DataFrame` with a column name (for instance, `coordinates`)\n",
    "6. Now, create a `OneHotEncoder` (important: do **NOT** set the parameter `sparse` to `False`. We definitely want sparsity for speed of training and memory usage), and `fit` your encoder on the `DataFrame` version of your corpus.\n",
    "7. Return your fitted `OneHotEncoder`.\n",

    "# Features Hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "`OneHotEncoding` is great because it gives us certainty of a 100% encoding without the risk of a clash of features; when using the `sparse_output` option, it can even handle some very large matrices fairly well, as we have seen with our `Feature Cross` before. But it has two major drawbacks:\n",
    "1. `OneHotEncoding` forces you to encode using the same number of columns as there are categories - this can become problematic for datasets with very large cardinality (think for instance of encoding all the English words using `OneHotEncoding`: impractical!)\n",
    "2. As you have discovered, if there is a feature category missing in the features you are trying to predict, `OneHotEncoding` cannot handle it and you need to set `handle_unknown=ignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will use a different encoding technique called `Feature Hashing`, also known as the ***hashing trick***. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing\">Wikipedia has a good page about this</a> in case you want to read more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to encode the values dataset by binning our features into a define number of categories, and then transform this into a sparse vector by applying a deterministic `hashing algorithm`. The exact details of the algorithm are not essential here (see the link above for some of the math), what matters is the principle. Note too that you can use `Feature Hashing` to reduce the dimensionality of the encoded dataset if you decide to.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One immense benefit of this approach is that categories outside of our bins will not break the code (they will just be assigned to the wrong bin)\n",
    "2. The number of bins (the `n_features` hyperparameter) is important. Too many of them, and you end up with the same cardinality as your original dataset (which is fine as long as the number of categories is not too high). Too few bins, and categories will start colliding, meaning you will introduce have more and more errors in your features.\n",
    "3. For practical applications, it is recommended to keep the number of features in the `sklearn` class as its default, or if you change it, keep the number to a power of 2 (<a href=\"https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/77819/how-should-i-choose-n-features-in-featurehasher-in-sklearn\">see this StackExchange post for more details</a>.\n",
    "4. It is important to realise that when we use `Feature Hashing` we sacrifice potential accuracy in exchange for practicality: either because we have a feature with too large a cardinality, or because we cannot necessarily always be sure that the categories we have at training will contain all of the categories at prediction time. If neither of these conditions are true, you moght be better off sticking with `OneHotEncoding` for maximum precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, `sklearn` has a `FeatureHasher` class(<a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.FeatureHasher.html\">see the documentation</a>. This class does not need to be fitted (i.e. no need to call the `.fit()` method, though it exists): you can simply call the `transform()` method on the data as the hashing is deterministic and does not depend on the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the following:\n",
    "1. Create a `ColumnTransformer` (let's call it `preprocessor` that contains your `numerical pipeline` from the previous step, and filters the same features as before (`['TempPreviousMonth','Latitude', 'Longitude']`)\n",
    "2. Instead of the `categorical encoder` that contained a `OneHotEncoder`, create a different categorical pipeline that contains a `FeatureHasher` (part of the `feature_extraction` module of `sklearn`). **Important:** Set the `input_type` parameter of your `FeaterHasher` to `'string'` since this is what we are using for `City_Country`\n",
    "3. If you run your pipeline with the `string` as it is, you will run into an issue. We need to provide a list of strings as input. The easiest is to quickly transform the `X_train.City_Country` column with a lambda function to be a list that contains the string (e.g. `'Kingston_Jamaica'` becomes `['Kingston_Jamaica']`). Make sure to also transform the `X_test.City_Country` for the test!\n",
    "4. combine your `preprocessor` with a `LinearRegression()` model into a new `Pipeline` named `city_model`\n",
    "5. Now `fit` the `city_model` to your `X_train` and `y_train`.\n"
